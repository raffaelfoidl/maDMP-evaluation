The volume of the files is 479 KB and 3285 KB respectively, and the data is open-source. This project produces an aggregated dataset in CSV format, containing data points that combine the two datasets used (meat consumption per capita and lung cancer deaths in Romania), having a file size of 1.44 KB, as well as two PNG visualizations of the data. The data will be available for long-term access and the CSV files are highly reusable, whereas the PNG files can be reused but they represent results for a very specific task. The CSV format was chosen for the generated data because it is highly reusable and very easy to read in multiple programming languages. The data will be stored in the cloud via GitHub.",
