For this purpose, data from two publicly available datasets were used: One dataset concerns the GDP per capita and the other contains data about the mean height of girls and boys of different ages per country. Both datasets consist of data collected over the course of several years; the year of interest for this experiment is 2019. The data entries from the two datasets were matched by comparing the country name given in the respective entry. Only countries are taken into consideration for which both datasets yield complete information - in total, 164 countries were considered in the experiment.",

This CSV file contains the raw data produced by the experiment; for each country, there are two entries in the CSV file: Each entry contains the country code, country name and the GDP per capita, which are obviously the same for both entries. The two entries differ in the columns for the sex and the mean height of 19-year-olds of this sex; there is one entry for males and another for females. Therefore, the created CSV file represents filtered and then merged data from the two input datasets. Additionally, two PNG files are generated which display a linear regression between the GDP per capita and the average height of 19-year-old males or females, respectively. A Python application is responsible for processing the data and producing the desired output.",
