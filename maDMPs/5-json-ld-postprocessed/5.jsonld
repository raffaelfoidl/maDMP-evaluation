The final dataset will have around 1 400 rows because of missing values in some rows. Long-term data on year, country, number of suicides and life expectancy should be retained.\n\nThe data will be created during the preprocessing. As a first step, I will start with the WHO Life Expectancy dataset. After loading data into pandas dataset, firstly, I will select wanted variables - country, year, life expectancy, adult mortality, infant deaths, alcohol, under-five deaths, HIV/AIDS, GDP, population, income composition of resources and schooling. Then, I will retype the variable year from Integere to String and set Country and Year as index. Then, I will check data by the functions such as head and dtypes and save the dataset as csv to the folder 10_Data named 10_life_expectancy_v01_clean.csv. As a second step, I will select following variables country, year, suicides number and population from the loaded second dataset WHO Suicide Statistics and I will rename the variable suicides_no to Suicides number and population to population2. I will also retype the variable year from Integere to String and set Country and Year as index. Then, I will drop all rows, where the values in the column suicides number are missing and group them by year and country. Then, I will check data by the functions such as head and dtypes and save the dataset as csv to the folder 10_Data named 20_suicide_rates_v01_clean.csv. As a last step, I will merge these two datasets by index – country and year. Then I will clean missing data: I will unify two population variables, for life expectancy I will delete all rows with missing values and for remaining variables I will add values using the function fill, which fill the values according to the previous row. After all, I will save the merged dataset as csv to the folder 10_Data named 30_merged_dataset_v00_final.csv.",

      "description": "In 2015, approximately 55 million people died worldwide, of which 8 million committed suicide. In the USA, one of the main causes of death is the aforementioned suicide, therefore, this experiment is dealing with the question of how much suicide rates affects the statistics of average life expectancy. \nThe experiment takes two datasets, one with the number of suicides and life expectancy in  the second one and combine data into one dataset. Subsequently, I try to find any patterns  and correlations among the variables and perform statistical test using simple regression to \nconfirm my assumptions.\n\nI will use Python 3.7.9, numpy 1.20.1, pandas 1.2.3 JupyterLab nootebook for data processing and for experiment as well. Moreover, I will use seaborn 0.11.1, matplotlib 3.4.1, statsmodels 0.12.2, scikit-learn 0.24.1 for the experiment. I will create two JupyterLab nootebooks: one for preprocessing and one for the experiment. I will write code into these notebooks.\n\nThe project will be divided into 4 folders using a pattern - [SERIAL_NUMBER]0_[DESCRIPTION] - for data, code, output, documents: 10_Data, 20_Code, 30_Output, 40_Documents. All files in the folders will use a pattern - [SERIAL_NUMBER]0_[DESCRIPTION]_[VERSION]_[ADDITION INFORMATION].[SUFFIX], or instance, 10_life_expectancy_v00_orig.csv for original dataset of life expectancy. The project will have 3 special files - LICENSE.md for a description of the license, README.md for a basic instroduction with the project and requirements.txt, where will be mentioned all libraries requirements. Versioning will be handled by special naming of the file and using the Github repository. I will also use versioning provided by Zenodo in the format X.X.X.\n\nThe source code will be create as two JupyterLab nootebooks, one for preprocessing named 10_preprocessing.ipynb, where will be implement the previously mentioned procedure, and one named 20_experiment.ipynb. In the second notebook there will be implemented the experiment, where I will start with loading the final dataset. Then I will create a second dataset which will be scaled by the min-max normalization. Firstly, I will describe the non-scaled dataset to get deeper insight into the data and check data quality, then I will display a correlation among all columns and filter more interested variables into the issue with two main variables suicides number, life expectancy and correlate a second time. After correlation, I will also display a pairplot of filtered variables and will look for the patterns. After these operations, I will lay down a hypothesis, which I will try to prove using a simple regression only between suicides number and life expectancy. Finally, I will save all figures and the final regression output to the folder 30_Output.\n\nData and source code will be stored on the Zenodo portal, for long-term storage. Source code will contain whole GitHub code with data, output and documents as well. The document folder will contain summary of the whole experiment with basic description of data, source code, results and the experiment diagram. I will also comment the source code and write the readme file of project, where will be abstract of the experiment, license, used technologies and how to run the experiment. Finally, I will fill all possible metadata provided by Zenodo, which are: publication date, title, authors, description, where will be mentioned the abstract of the project, basic data description and license, version, language, keywords, license and contact person with ORCID. Zenodo will automatically create DOI.\n\nUsers will find out about the project through two portals - Zenodo and Github - and also through the university. \n\nSince this project is carried out by an individual, all responsibility falls on him. This applies to the implementation of the DMP, and ensuring it is reviewed and revised, as well as data management activity. The individual will be responsible for all activities data capture, metadata production, data quality, storage and backup, data archiving & data sharing, as well as ensuring that data will be FAIR.\n\nI will use my expertise and freely available information from the Internet to deliver my plan. To run the experiment, I will use free resources and run it on my computer",
