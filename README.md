# maDMP Evaluation

## Introduction

Machine-actionable data management plans (maDMPs) have, by their very nature, advantages over data management plans that
are written exclusively in text form.
By employing maDMPs, not only researches should be able to benefit from their merits, but also research funders receiving
and assessing the DMPs.

In its _[Practical Guide to the International Alignment of Research Data Management](https://www.scienceeurope.org/our-resources/practical-guide-to-the-international-alignment-of-research-data-management/)_,
Science Europe has published an evaluation rubric (section _Guidance for Reviewers_) that provides a solid basis to support
research (funding) organisations in evaluating DMPs.
By stating a set of criteria, it helps to ensure submitted DMPs cover required aspects and support [FAIR data management](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/).

## Covered Criteria

The tables in the following subsections depict which criteria from the evaluation rubric we were able to express via SPARQL queries.

## Assessment report

In this section, we want to present an aggregated assessment of the maDMPs submitted to the aforementioned
[Zenodo community](https://zenodo.org/communities/dast-2021/).
As it is possible to determine the respective authors from the content of an maDMP, we want to clarify that we - of course -
do not intend to disparage neither the efforts that went into creating the documents nor the authors themselves by this assessment
in any way.
We merely utilized the files as realistic test data since they stem from experiments with diverse topics - in order to
gauge the utility of the SPARQL queries developed during our project.
