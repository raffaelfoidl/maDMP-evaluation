The chapter [Covered Criteria](https://raffaelfoidl.github.io/maDMP-evaluation/0004.html) gave a brief overview of the
queries developed over the course of the project. Furthermore, it also contains assumptions that had to be made as well
as challenges we faced.

Overall, the Science Europe Evaluation Rubric defines 6 broad categories in its assessment guideline. The following
table gives of the spectrum we were able to cover with our queries.
