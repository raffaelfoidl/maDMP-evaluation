### Input Pipeline

The maDMPs we use as raw input data for our project are taken directly from the Zenodo
Community [Data Stewardship 2021 - DMPs](https://zenodo.org/communities/dast-2021/).

1. Start with raw maDMPs from the Zenodo Community.
2. Ensure [schema](https://github.com/RDA-DMP-Common/RDA-DMP-Common-Standard/blob/master/examples/JSON/JSON-schema/1.1/maDMP-schema-1.1.json)
conformity, uniform formatting and indenting
3. Normalization: Establish uniform, alphabetical sorting of JSON properties.
4. Convert JSON/Turtle maDMPs to
   a [DCSO](https://github.com/RDA-DMP-Common/RDA-DMP-Common-Standard/tree/master/ontologies) instance in a JSON-LD
   serialization using the `dcsojon` tool.
5. Apply postprocessing to the JSON-LD maDMPs (again, establish uniform, alphabetical sorting of JSON-LD properties).

Regarding step 2, the following changes had to be made in order to achieve schema conformity for all input maDMPs:

* `4.json`
    * removed line breaks within JSON string literals
* `6.json`
    * some closing brackets were missing
    * object nesting hierarchy in the `distribution` field was incorrect (we could only make a guess as to the author's
      original intentions)
* `10.json`
    * objects instead of arrays with one element were used
    * sometimes, strings instead of numerical values (e.g. `int`) were used
    * two of the four data sets did not exhibit the required `dataset_id` field
    * on one occasion, a datetime format was used instead of a date
* `11.json`
    * correction regarding datetime format: `2021-04-12T25:10:16.8` -> `2021-04-12T25:10:16.8Z`
    * correction regarding incorrect time value: `2021-04-12T25:10:16.8Z` -> `2021-04-12T23:10:16.8Z` (a day does not
      have more than 24 hours)

Step 4 has been performed automatically via
the [convert.sh](https://github.com/raffaelfoidl/maDMP-evaluation/blob/main/maDMPs/convert.sh) shell script. For more
information on the `dcso-json` tool invoked by this script, please refer to
the [dcso-json overview](https://raffaelfoidl.github.io/maDMP-evaluation/0008.html).

### Processing of the Semantic maDMP Representation

After having brought the maDMPs into a semantically enriched JSON-LD format, we were ready to express requirements from
the evaluation rubric mentioned in the [Project Overview](https://raffaelfoidl.github.io/maDMP-evaluation/0001.html). We
developed queries that project certain subsets of the data into a customized view (`SELECT` queries) as well as ones
that simply indicate whether some criteria are satisfied (`ASK` queries).

A more in-depth, but still summarized, overview of the queries we created can be observed
in [Queries](https://raffaelfoidl.github.io/maDMP-evaluation/0005.html). The queries themselves are available in
the [queries](https://github.com/raffaelfoidl/maDMP-evaluation/tree/main/queries) directory.

During our experiment, we used a local [GraphDB](https://www.ontotext.com/products/graphdb/) instance as triple store
and SPARQL endpoint. Other triple stores such as [Jena Fuseki](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2/) are of
course eligible as well. However, as a result of previous experiences with it, we opted for GraphDB.

### Report on Quality of Input maDMPs

Finally, after having created the queries, we applied them to the maDMPs that made up our input and which had previously
been imported into a GraphDB repository. The results of this assessment can be found in
the [Assessment Report](https://raffaelfoidl.github.io/maDMP-evaluation/0006.html).
