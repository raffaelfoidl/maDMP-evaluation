In this section, we want to present an aggregated assessment of the maDMPs submitted to the aforementioned
[Zenodo community](https://zenodo.org/communities/dast-2021/). As it is possible to determine the respective authors
from the content of an maDMP, we want to clarify that we - of course - do not intend to disparage neither the efforts
that went into creating the documents nor the authors themselves by this assessment in any way. We merely utilized the
files as realistic test data since they stem from experiments with diverse topics - in order to gauge the utility of the
SPARQL queries developed during our project.
