title: "5 Assessment Report"
author: "Raffael Foidl, Lea Salome Brugger"
---

In this section, we want to present an aggregated assessment of the maDMPs submitted to the aforementioned
[Zenodo community](https://zenodo.org/communities/dast-2021/). As it is possible to determine the respective authors
from the content of an maDMP, we want to clarify that we - of course - do not intend to disparage neither the efforts
that went into creating the documents nor the authors themselves by this assessment in any way. We merely utilized the
files as realistic test data since they stem from experiments with diverse topics - in order to gauge the utility of the
SPARQL queries developed during our project. The tables below form a summary of our attempts at evaluating the maDMPs.

The column(s) "Satisfaction Value" are numeric on a scale from zero to five. A value of five is equivalent
to a holistic fulfilment of the respective criterion, a value of zero either denotes that the criterion is "not satisfied"
or that the SPARQL queries are not able to extract the required pieces of information.

Due to the missing `host` definition, a lot of information could not be extracted with the queries. There is virtually no
documentation of metadata. Information about the data management repsonsibilities is missing as well.
Apart from those aspects, the maDMP provides a decent informational value.

A lot of (important) information is missing in this maDMP. Hence, one can conclude based on the assessment with our queries that
the maDMP provides insufficient documentation and is therefore of rather bad quality.

The documentation of the metadata is not satisfactory. Furthermore, there is no information regarding security
considerations, data preservation and backups. All in all, this maDMP provides sufficient documentation without being
of exceptional quality.

This maDMP could be assessed quite well; based on the results one can argue that this maDMP is excellent.
The only missing aspect concerns the costs of the project.

The main issue here is the lack of metadata documentation. Aside from that, the maDMP fails to provide information about
data storage and preservation, backups and security measures. The other aspects were elaborated sufficiently. In conclusion,
this maDMP is of decent quality.

There was apparently some confusion regarding the metadata standards. Apart from that, there are only a few small

Since the JSON-LD maDMP was surprisingly short in content, a manual look into the source maDMP revealed that there are
a lot of fields that are not actually part of the RDA-DMP Common Standard and thus, not queryable with our approach. From
this assessment, one can conclude that the maDMP is of poor quality.

Overall, this maDMP could be assessed decently well and turned out to be of excellent quality based on the evaluation
with our queries. Missing aspects were mostly due to the maDMP schema, a preservation statement would have provided some
more information.

### Conclusion

The table below displays the average satisfaction value for each category defined in the rubric as well as the average
sum.

As one can see in the table and the individual evaluations above, the main issues in the input maDMPs are insufficient
documentation of the metadata accompanying the used and produced data as well as lacking information about the storage
and backup of data (categories 2 and 3). Regarding the other categories, most of the maDMPs provided a decent amount of information,
with a few shortcomings here and there. One aspect worth mentioning here is the missing definition of the `host` element
which is an issue that appeared in quite a few maDMPs. Furthermore, the cost were neglected in all maDMPs, the required
resources were only specified in one maDMP.

Nevertheless, based on the evaluation with our queries one can argue that all maDMPs are of good (or at least sufficient) quality.

With respect to the quality and usefulness of our queries, as already mentioned in the introduction to this section,
some queries could be made more tolerant against not having  defined optional schema elements.
This would improve the results in gauging maDMPs. Other than that, they proved to be quite useful in assessing the set of
input maDMPs.

All in all, the SPARQL queries can certainly serve as a starting point for reviewers. However, it is certainly worth noting that
queries are mostly kept rather general in order to be applicable to the quite diverse input files.  Hence, one might need to adjust
them to fit one's specific domain and requirements.
