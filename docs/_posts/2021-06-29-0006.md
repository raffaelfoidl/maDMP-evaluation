title: "6 Assessment Report"
author: "Raffael Foidl, Lea Salome Brugger"
---

In this section, we want to present an aggregated assessment of the maDMPs submitted to the aforementioned
[Zenodo community](https://zenodo.org/communities/dast-2021/). As it is possible to determine the respective authors
from the content of an maDMP, we want to clarify that we - of course - do not intend to disparage neither the efforts
that went into creating the documents nor the authors themselves by this assessment in any way. We merely utilized the
files as realistic test data since they stem from experiments with diverse topics - in order to gauge the utility of the
SPARQL queries developed during our project. The tables below form a summary of our attempts at evaluating the maDMPs.

The column(s) "Satisfaction Value" are numeric on a scale from zero to five. A value of five is equivalent
to a holistic fulfilment of the respective criterion, a value of zero either denotes that the criterion is "not satisfied"
or that the SPARQL queries are not able to extract the required pieces of information.

According to the results of the queries, this maDMP has a quite high amount of information required by the evaluation rubric, hinting at good quality.

    <td>maDMP does not have <code>host</code> elements defined, therefore a lot of important information is missing (PID system, backup strategies, URLs etc.). There is no preservation statement, therefore no information about research uses and preservation details (which data is kept, how to select etc.).

However, the SPARQL query is a little bit too strict and fails due to the missing <code>host</code> definition.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>6 Data Management Responsibilities and Resources</td>

    <td>Creator/contact person is defined, but no contributors and their roles. Costs of storing and backing up the data are also specified in the maDMP.</td>

Due to the missing `host` definition, a lot of information could not be extracted with the queries. Apart from that,
the maDMP did provide a decent informational value.

Since the JSON-LD maDMP was surprisingly short in content, a manual look into the source maDMP revealed that there are
a lot of fields that are not actually part of the RDA DMP Common Standard and thus, not queryable with our approach.

    <td>Substantial information about the data hosts (GitHub, Zenodo) and licensing/usage (sensitive data, embargo, openness). No explicit data preservation statement (missing data: retention period, data destruction, what data is kept). No target audiences (foreseeable research uses).</td>

Overall, this maDMP could be assessed decently well. Missing aspects were mostly due to the maDMP schema, a preservation
statement would have provided some more information.

Common pitfalls of maDMPs, where are queries lacking and why, ... 

As already mentioned in the introduction to this section, some queries could be made more tolerant against not having
defined optional schema elements. This would improve the results in gauging maDMPs.
